	Program created to increase speed edition of images from
	Nintendo 3DS game "Ace Attorney Trilogy".
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
	"Ace Attorney Trilogy" is a very big game, with lots
	of text images to be edited:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		White buttons with text in wine red color;
		<img src="img/background_botoes_preenchido.png" />
	</li>
	<li>
		Proof / Profile names, with dark gray background and texts in orange color;
		<img src="img/background_nomes_preenchido.png" />
	</li>
	<li>
		Proof / Profile subtitles, with light green background and texts in dark gray color;
		<img src="img/background_subtitulos_preenchido.png" />
	</li>
	<li>
		Proof / Profile descriptions, with dark gray background and texts in white color;
		<img src="img/background_descricao_preenchido.png" style="background: #444;" />
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-justify">
	The traditional way of editing those graphics is through .PSD files
	in Adobe Photoshop, which ends up being an extremely repetitive and
	tiresome task for romhackers. This was the main reason why I created
	this software.

<p class="text-justify">
	The "Ace Attorney Image Generator" is a program that can generate imagens
	on the same patterns of "Ace Attorney Trilogy" game. For such task, the
	following technologies were used:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>HTML5, for web page creation;</li>
	<li>CSS3, for text styling on images;</li>
	<li>JavaScript and <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>, for fields' and buttons' programming;</li>
	<li><a href="http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/" target="_blank">Html2canvas</a>, for converting HTML elements to PNG images;</li>
	<li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, to become this page responsive;</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/seiyria/bootstrap-slider" target="_blank">Bootstrap Slider</a>, for scale and margin fields;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		A modern updated web browser. Google Chrome is recommended, since a few
		CSS behaviour differences can be seen on other browsers such as Firefox,
		Safari or IE;
	</li>
	<li>
		The "Arial" font installed on your computer. Needed for the right generation
		of some kinds of images, such as buttons per example (If you're using
		any Windows SO, you can ignore this);
	</li>
	<li>
		The "Vaud Book" font installed on your computer. Needed for the right generation
		of some kinds of images, such as descriptions of proofs / profiles;
	</li>
	<li>
		A web server. This software won't work if ran locally by user's web
		browser¹.
	</li>
</ul>
<sup>
	1. Even if this software being totally local, the method used for image generation
	(conversion of HTML &lt;canvas&gt; elements to PNG images) can trigger an
	<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22710627/tainted-canvases-may-not-be-exported" target="_blank">
		uncaught security error of tainted canvases
	</a>, denying any attempts of data exporting. Thus, we recommend to run this software
	through a web server (Apache2, per example), even if it's only to serve files to clients.

<h4>How to use?</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Select image type, by clicking on any of the tabs "Buttons", "Proof / Profile Names", etc;</li>
	<li>In the text field, type the text to be shown on the image;</li>
	<li>Optional: If applicable, change values of scale, font and margins accordingly to the text you typed;</li>
	<li>
		Optional: If you wish to use external fonts, do the following:
		<ul>
			<li>In "Font" field, choose "Another";</li>
			<li>In the text field on the right, type the name of the font;</li>
			<li>

			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>

		updated on the "Preview" below. Change the form fields as you wish,
		and check if the preview matches your needs;
	</li>
	<li>
